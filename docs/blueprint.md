# **App Name**: InjurEase

## Core Features:

- Predictive Injury Risk Scoring: Uses historical data, workload, recovery, and biomechanics to provide a daily injury risk score, alerting users to potential risks.
- Real-Time Biomechanical Analysis: Utilizes smartphone camera and machine learning pose estimation for gait/technique analysis, detecting movement inefficiencies. Wearable integration is optional.
- Adaptive AI Exercise Prescription: Generates dynamic, personalized corrective routines based on injury risk, recent performance, pain feedback, sleep data, and HRV. Uses a tool to decide on corrective exercises.
- Longitudinal Load Management: Visualizes workload trends over time, showing acute:chronic workload ratios and alerting users to workload spikes.
- Recovery & Physiology Integration: Integrates with sleep trackers, HRV data, and perceived stress questionnaires for holistic risk modeling.
- Technique Breakdown and Feedback: Analyzes user-uploaded videos of movements, providing frame-by-frame biomechanical feedback and corrections using reference animations.
- Gamified Prevention Quests: Implements a gamified system with badges, team challenges, and leaderboards to encourage consistent use and engagement.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Strong, vivid red (#E63946) to evoke the urgency of injury prevention and the energy of sports.
- Background color: Light pink (#F1FAEE), a desaturated hue of red to give enough contrast without being visually tiring.
- Accent color: Sky Blue (#A8DADC) for clarity and calmness in contrast to the more alarming primary color, also promoting action through actionable UI elements
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' sans-serif for a modern, techy, scientific feel. Body Font: 'Inter' sans-serif.
- Use minimalist icons representing different body parts and types of exercises.
- Clean, card-based layout for presenting injury risk scores, exercise recommendations, and biomechanical feedback.
- Subtle animations and transitions to highlight critical information and guide user interactions.
